1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 



3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 factor with levels=1:6 'WALKING', 'WALKING_UPSTAIRS', 'WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS','SITTING','STANDING','LAYING'

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

I used a "for" loop to: 
- cycle through each header name
- place the header into a temporary variable
- replace and editing each temp header with a sequence of gsub calls
- save each updated header into a new headers-only table
- Once all my changes were completed in the for loop
- replaced the main data table headers with the items in my updated headers-only table

  "Acc"," Accelerometer "
  "^t" replaced with "Time "
  "-" replaced with " "
  "mean" replaced with "Mean Value "
  "[:():]" replaced with ""
  "Gyro" replaced with "Gyroscope "
  "Jerk" replaced with "Jerk "
  "^f" replaced with "Frequency "
  "BodyBody" replaced with "Body "
  "Body" replaced with "Body "
  "std" replaced with "Standard Deviation"
  "X" replaced with " Signal In X Direction"
