This is the Codebook describing the approach that was followed to execute the followin step 1 to step 5.

1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

- Merged the training and the test sets to create one data set (10299 observations with 563 variables) 
2.	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
- used grepl 

data set is now :10299 observations with 81 variables


3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
 factor with levels=1:6 'WALKING', 'WALKING_UPSTAIRS', 'WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS','SITTING','STANDING','LAYING'

4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

I used a "for" loop to: 
- cycle through each header name
- place the header into a temporary variable
- replace and editing each temp header with a sequence of gsub calls
- save each updated header into a new headers-only table
- Once all my changes were completed in the for loop
- replaced the main data table headers with the items in my updated headers-only table

- 
- given that XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

  "Acc"," Accelerometer "
  "^t" replaced with "Time "
  "-" replaced with " "
  "mean" replaced with "Mean Value "
  "[:():]" replaced with ""
  "Gyro" replaced with "Gyroscope "
  "Jerk" replaced with "Jerk "
  "^f" replaced with "Frequency "
  "BodyBody" replaced with "Body "
  "Body" replaced with "Body "
  "std" replaced with "Standard Deviation"
  "X" replaced with " Signal In X Direction"
  "Y" replaced with " Signal In Y Direction"
  "Z" replaced with " Signal In Z Direction"
  
  Here is the output:

5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent 
   tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
   
   - used groupby followed by a summarized and calculated the average
   - 180 observations with 81 variables Names + 2 for the subject and activity
   - 180 observations (rows): subject (30) x activity (6 different activities)
   - 81 variables(columns): columns from the average of the measurements for mean and standard deviation
