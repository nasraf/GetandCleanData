GetandCleanData
===============
- In the run_analysis.R script I did not include any command where to go and get input files. 
- I download the files manually as in the evaluation setting it was stated that 
- "the Samsung data is in your working directory"  

The following are the list of all the files and scripts 
- 'README.txt'
- run_analysis.R: R script to execute 
- -tidydata.txt'
