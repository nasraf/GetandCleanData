    1.	Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

    3.	Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
    4.	Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
    5.	From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each 
        variable for each activity and each subject.

- -tidydata.txt': output contain the data of step 5 listed-above. It contains the following varibales:
